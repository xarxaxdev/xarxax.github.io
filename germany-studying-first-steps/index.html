<p>There are quire a few steps you have to take before you are properly enrolled and you don&rsquo;t have to worry about bureaucracy. Some are legal requirements, some will allow you to save up money.</p>
<p>Things that will save you money and you should do AT LEAST a year in advance (even if you are missing many documents and you have not even been accepted on a degree). If you are missing any documents apply anyway and send the documents as you get them:</p>
<ul>
<li>For applying to the biggest scholarship <a href="https://www3.daad.de/deutschland/stipendium/datenbank/en/21148-scholarship-database/">DAAD</a>. Waiting for an acceptance letter made my application invalid and and lost any chance at this scholarship. This can be easily <a href="https://www2.daad.de/deutschland/stipendium/datenbank/en/21148-scholarship-database/?status=3&amp;origin=41&amp;subjectGrps=F&amp;daad=&amp;intention=&amp;q=&amp;page=1&amp;detail=50026200">900 euros a month</a> .</li>
<li>For student housing if you want to have a place by the time you begin your degree, you should apply a year in advance as well. As far as I understand, each region of Germany has its own Studentwerk/ Studentenwohnheim rules; it is still more than likely that if you have not applied a year prior you will not get a place by the time you wish to move in. I personally waited until getting an acceptance letter, which meant I had to stay many months in limbo regarding housing.</li>
</ul>
<p>(All transcribed in English or German) Things you will need for applying (or at least that I needed for applying to mine):</p>
<ul>
<li>A degree you are aiming to apply for (you should fulfill the qualifications for said degree). Use <a href="https://www.uni-assist.de/">uni-assist</a> for managing the application.</li>
<li>A motivation letter for the degree you are applying.</li>
<li>An official certificate of being qualified enough in the language of the degree you are applying for. Generally speaking, most degrees in German will need a B2 and most degrees in English will need a C1; but you should find it in the degree requirements.</li>
<li>(Only if you are doing a Master&rsquo;s) Your Bachelor&rsquo;s full credits transcript (including subjects), with some stamp or signature. You may also need a proof of completion for it.</li>
<li>Your university passing qualifications (high school diploma + entrance university grades) with a stamp or signature (even if you are applying for a Master and have a Bachelor&rsquo;s). I personally managed to get away without transcribing this, but it is very likely you&rsquo;ll need to. I will also say that this was only necessary for registering when starting in the university, not for applying to the program itself.</li>
<li>Your local country ID</li>
<li>Your Curriculum Vitae (depends on the degree).</li>
</ul>
<p>Thing you should be able to provide right before you actually begin your studies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proof of you being legally insured by a German company (can be obtained exactly when you begin studying, needs only to be valid for the classes period).</li>
<li>Passport valid to get in Germany or VISA</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="good-etiquette">Good etiquette</h3>
<p>While this is not a requirement by any means and I have no proof of how relevant it is when it comes to getting accepted; I was recommended to show some etiquette in the uni-assist when delivering the required files. Delivering the proper files scanned rather than on a phone picture, with proper naming and format (your Curriculum Vitae should be &ldquo;curriculum_vitae.pdf&rdquo;) makes the work of whoever is looking at the application easier and shows diligence.</p>
