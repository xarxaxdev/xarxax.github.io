<p>Here I will go over the main reasons for using ASP, syntax, and best practices.
Feel free to check my <a href="https://github.com/xarxaxdev/asp_implementations">github repo</a> for working examples (if this is useful to you, consider dropping a star). All the specific syntax I use is from clingo.</p>
<h1 id="what-problem-does-an-asp-solve">What problem does an ASP solve?</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming">ASP</a> is, as the wiki page states, a good approach to solving NP-hard problems where we want to establish a search space and let a solver find a solution without having to design an algorithm (but keeping some explainability). In a more practical way, we write programs that are lists of rules; then we let a solver find solution/s that satisfy <strong>all rules</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="what-does-it-mean-to-satisfy-all-rules">What does it mean to satisfy all rules?</h1>
<p>All rules are in the shape <code>head :- body</code> which roughly translates to the logic statement <code>head &lt;- body</code>, which is a logical equivalence to <code>head or not(body)</code>. To satisfy all rules is then equivalent to find a set of variables such that for each rule either the head is true, or the body is false .</p>
<p>If you come from Prolog this is extremely familiar; the advantage being that ASP can deal with circular loops.</p>
<h1 id="syntax">Syntax</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go over practical, concise explanations on semantics:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>head &lt;- rule.</code></dt>
<dd>head is part of a solution if rule is part of a solution</dd>
<dt><code>head &lt;-.</code></dt>
<dd>head is part of a solution (always)</dd>
<dt><code> &lt;- rule.</code></dt>
<dd>rule cannot be part of the solution</dd>
<dt><code>{head }&lt;- rule.</code></dt>
<dd>head is (or not) a part of a solution if rule is a part of a solution</dd>
<dt><code>head &lt;- {rule1;rule2}.</code></dt>
<dd>head is a part of a solution if rule1 OR rule2 is a part of a solution</dd>
<dt><code>{head1;head2} &lt;- rule.</code></dt>
<dd>head1  or head2 are a part of a solution if rule is a part of a solution. We can read the <code>;</code> as an OR.</dd>
<dt><code>L{head1;head2;head3}U &lt;- rule.</code></dt>
<dd>[L,U] heads are a part of a solution if rule is a part of a solution</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="syntax-extension-with-variables">Syntax extension with variables</h1>
<dl>
<dt><code>L{var_head_1(A,B):var(B);var_head_2(A,C):var(C)}U &lt;- var_body(A).</code></dt>
<dd>for every var_body(A) we guessi a total of [L,U] (summing var_head_1 and var_head_2) are a part of a solution. Each <code>var_head_1(A,B)</code> needs there to be a corresponding <code>var(B)</code>(and the same applies to <code>(var_head_2(A,C)</code> and <code>var(C)</code>). We can read the <code>:</code> as &ldquo;such that&rdquo;.</dd>

<h3 id="general-methodology">General methodology</h3>
<p>It is just good practice to use the methodology <a href="https://teaching.potassco.org/">officially recomended</a>. The approach suggested is called generate (rules with <code>{}</code> on the head) and test (rules of the shape <code>:-body</code>). Generate refers to the fact that, in the simplest of cases <code>{a}.</code>, the solver will clone every pre-existing solution that didn&rsquo;t have <code>a</code> and add <code>a</code> to it (if <code>a</code> had not been referenced, duplicating the solutions).</p>
<p>I will add to this methodology that implications <code>head :- body</code> by themselves only extend the current solution by <em>sometimes</em> deducing some variables. If we had 3 solutions prior to an implication, we will keep the same solutions with some more variables on them.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfalls">Common pitfalls</h3>
<p><em>I want to create the pairs of different numbers between 1 and 2. I have <code>num(1).num(2).</code></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Wrong solution <code>pair(A,B):- num(A),num(B)</code>.</li>
<li>Correct solution <code>pair(A,B):- num(A),num(B),A!=B</code>.</li>
<li>Reason: The body <code>num(A),num(B)</code> will be generated for EVERY possible combination of A and B. If the body was <code>num(A),num(A)</code> we have forced the variable substitution to be the same, but when using difference variables we have to manually enforce it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I am getting too many incorrect solutions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>That is the easiest thing to solve; when you run <code>clingo</code> you can check which invalid solutions appear, and looking at your program you should be able to infer which constraints (<code>:-body.</code>) have to be more restrictive or new ones to add.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Now I am getting an UNSAT</em></p>
<ul>
<li>UNSAT have to be caused by constraints. What you can do is add a head <code>error(&quot;error text&quot;)</code> as a head of a <code>:-body</code> constraint. Next you can add (probably at the end of the program) a constraint of the shape <code>:-error(_).</code>. To identify which constraint is too restrictive, you can test commenting the head  <code>error(&quot;error text&quot;)</code> of the particular error you are testing. If a constraint is filtering all your solutions; it is too restrictive or you were not generating enough solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Let me create this relation that uses 6+ terms and expresses perfectly all the constraints of the problem</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Wrong solution: using long rules in general.</li>
<li>Correct solution: split into smaller implications and relations</li>
<li>Reason: #1 it becomes very difficult to identify what exact part of the rule is the one that is breaking. #2 there are rarely relations with so many prerequisites. #3 heads are generated according to the <strong>combinations</strong> of bodies they have. You are greatly increasing the complexity of the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>My program never finishes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>You probably have an incremental loop with no ceiling in a rule like this: <code>var(I+1):-var(I)</code>(or the increment involves several rules). A quick test of who is at fault is to add a reasonable cap (100 iterations should be instantaneous) and see if it terminates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="efficiency-tricks">Efficiency tricks</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, the easiest way to increase efficiency is to generate less <strong>possible</strong> variables. Lets use an example from the <a href="https://github.com/xarxaxdev/asp_implementations">github</a> on robots.</p>
<p>A specific (but very common) example:</p>
<p><em>Robots doing some tasks in a map represented by edges edge(Node1,Node2). There is also a time T.</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Robots on a map can move to somewhere adjacent.</em></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Inefficient solution:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{at(R,N2,T+1)}=1:-at(R,N1,T)} ,time(T+1).% a robot will be exactly at one place at a time
:- at(R,N2,T+1),at(R,N1,T),edge(N1,N2) . % no teleporting
</code></pre><ul>
<li>Efficient solution</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{at(R,N2,T): edge(N1,N2);at(R,N1,T)}=1 :- at(R,N1,T-1),time(T).% a robot will exactly be at one adjactent place at a time
</code></pre><ul>
<li>Reason: The inefficient solution HAS to generate every possible combination (Robot,Node,Time) which grows cubicly with the problem. The efficient version allows only to generate the adjacent variables.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><em>These robots have to do a series of tasks in a certain order.</em></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Inefficient version</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>can_be_done(J,O,T2):- %operation O of job J can be done at T2
	operation(J,O-1,_),%the previous operation exists
	done(J,O-1,T1),time(T2),T1&lt;T2.% previos was finished before
</code></pre><ul>
<li>Efficient version</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>done(J,O,T) :- done(J,O,T-1),time(T).
can_be_done(J,O,T2):- %operation O of job J can be done at T2
	operation(J,O-1,_),%the previous operation exists
	done(J,O-1,T2-1).% previos was finished before
</code></pre><ul>
<li>Reason: The inefficient version has to check every combination T1,T2; this is very inefficient as bit T values happen. In the efficient version, we generate a lot more &ldquo;superfluous&rdquo; <code>done(_,_,_)</code> statements; however that reduces the dimensionality of <code>can_be_done</code>.</li>
</ul>
