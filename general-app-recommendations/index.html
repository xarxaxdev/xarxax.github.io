<p>These are some of the apps I have used over the years, and from those they are the ones that are more focused to work with a general public (whoever does not want to use a Terminal). There is a bias towards using open-source, specially for apps that are just extremely common to use (email, browser, etc). These tend to be ad-free and focused on usability.</p>
<p>Open-source simple apps that are available for Windows and Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/">Thunderbird</a> is the mail client that everyone should be using. Besides being open-source(so not snooping in your data) and donation based, it is very average-person friendly. As an adult you probably have 3+ mails on different websites (company, studies, private, spam, etc). This is a hassle to work with if you are using a browser tab for each mail; Thunderbird solves that.</li>
<li><a href="http://jonls.dk/redshift/">Redshift</a> is a red light filter (for burning your eyesight less and sleeping better if you look at screens at night).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">Libreoffice</a> is like Microsoft Word (but open-source).</li>
<li><a href="https://chromium.woolyss.com/">Chromium</a> is basically Google Chrome (but open-source).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> is an image editor (like Photoshop, but open-source).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> is a music and video player.</li>
<li><a href="https://kodi.tv/">Kodi</a> is an media-player more useful for when you are watching a series.</li>
<li><a href="https://gparted.org/">Gparted</a> is a very nice tool for managing your disks/storage/hard drive partitions.</li>
<li><a href="https://gedit-technology.github.io/apps/gedit/">Gedit</a> is a simple text editor like Notepad.</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.kde.org/filelight/">Filelight</a> is a way to check how full your disk is and which folder is taking space.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.texstudio.org/">Texstudio</a> This is a very beginner friendly to use LaTex (format for scientific papers) editor. If you have never heard of LaTex ignore this app.</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-open source:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://justgetflux.com/">F.lux</a> Is the red light filter you should use if Redshift is not working for you.</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikiloc.wikilocandroid&amp;hl=es">Wikiloc</a> is pretty nice for hiking local routes</li>
</ul>
