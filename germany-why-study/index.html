<h2 id="economically">Economically</h2>
<p>There are many publicly funded Master and Bachelor programs, where the only costs that you will pay are the University fees. For me, studying in a public Bachelor&rsquo;s in Spain (which is cheaper than a Master) cost me roughly 1.2k euros a semester, assuming I never had to repeat a subject (otherwise I had to pay 200 more euros plus the normal price for that subject) and with only the tuition fees included. Conversely, where I study now I pay slightly above 300 euros a semester that include a transport ticket for the whole Brandenburg region.</p>
<p>You may also find better conditions for work or research in Germany as well. To give an example, it was relatively hard for me to find C++ developer jobs in Barcelona, where as in Germany they are quite requested. The same goes for robotics and some other niche fields.</p>
<h2 id="wholistic-university-approach">Wholistic university approach</h2>
<p>The student deal on public transport is only one example of how the conditions for living in Germany are quite welcoming in general.  Please take into account that <strong>the minimum wage is 1584 eur</strong> when looking at those. These are other factors well integrated (in Potsdam University):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.studentenwerk-potsdam.de/en/housing/our-halls-of-residence#/">Student housing (Studentenwohnheim)</a> can cost you as little as 210 euros. Add 5 euros per month more for internet.</li>
<li>Eating at the <a href="https://www.studentenwerk-potsdam.de/en/food-co/our-canteens-and-cafeterias">uni cafeteria (Mensa)</a> will usually cost you 3~5eur for a rather complete (and healthy) dish.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/zessko/languages/overview">Language courses</a> (although limited) are for free for students. There are also <a href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/zessko/languages/overview/forms-of-learning">other options</a> in the uni to further help if you want to improve your conversational skills.</li>
<li><a href="https://buchung.hochschulsport-potsdam.de/angebote/aktueller_zeitraum/index.html">Sports classes</a> for 4 months (2h a week) for 20 euros.</li>
<li>Extremely abundant part-time offers intended for students or minijobs</li>
<li>Student bars that are voluntary-managed and have affordable prices</li>
</ul>
<p>I write this as I am studying my master in Potsdam since 2022. I am physically studying there and my German as of now (12.2023) is still not very good. You can read on the requirements for studying in Germany <a href="/germany-studying-first-steps">in my first steps guide</a></p>
